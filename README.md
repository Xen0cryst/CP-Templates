# Competitive Programming Templates

This repository contains a collection of optimized templates for competitive programming. Each template is designed to reduce boilerplate code and improve efficiency during contests like IOI and ICPC.

## Templates Available

- **C++ Fast I/O and File Handling**: A template with fast input/output handling, modular functions, and utility algorithms like GCD, LCM, modular exponentiation, and more.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes commonly used functions for competitive programming, such as array manipulation, sorting utilities, mathematical operations, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Templates for common algorithms like binary search, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Xen0cryst/CP-Templates.git
    ```

2. Choose the template you need, modify it as required, and start solving problems.
